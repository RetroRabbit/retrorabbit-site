So, we built an online self-service portal that lets you get a quote, submit claims, make policy amendments, and basically get insurance as fast as you can type. Which means no more holding for the next available operator."

So, we built a platform which gamifies business training, allowing people to learn and have fun at the same time. With mini games and trivia questions, accessible both on web and mobile, you can gain real-world business insights, at home in your PJs."

Most people need a better way of tracking their money, to make sure their world doesn't end when the next bill's due. So, we created a super helpful mobile app that lets users track spending, manage bills, and earn rewards for sticking to a budget. Now, we're not saying we saved the world with this appâ€¦but we certainly helped lots of people in the world save."

So, we built an app that lets good people (who have services to sell) find other good people (who want to pay for those services), easily and quickly. That means professionals can spend less time looking for work, and more time doing work. And clients can find real professionals, instead of some guy whose flyer they took at the traffic light."
